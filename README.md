## questions

* linear or classification? The prediction is continous between 1-10, thus a linear learner seems to be appropiate.
* How to create temporal abstraction exactly? Take into consideration that also ARIMA or RNN is later applied to it?
* How to organise temporal abstraction when it will also be used with a RNN? Look into implementation with Keras or Tensorflow.
* Where to find literature?
* How define proper performance metric and graphs when dealing with regression learners?
